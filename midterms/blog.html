    <h2>Batman (Bruce Wayne)</h2>
    <p>
      Batman is the superhero protector of Gotham City, a tortured, brooding
      vigilante dressed as a bat who fights against evil <br />
      and strikes fear into the hearts of criminals everywhere. In his public
      identity, he is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire industrialist and notorious
      playboy.<br />
      Although he has no superhuman abilities, he is one of the world's smartest
      men and greatest fighters. His physical prowess, technical ingenuity, and
      tactical thinking make him an incredibly dangerous opponent.<br />
      He is also a founding member of the Justice League.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bruce Wayne was born to wealthy physician Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife
      Martha, who were themselves members<br />
      of the prestigious Wayne and Kane families of Gotham City,
      respectively.<br />
      When he was three, Bruce's mother Martha was expecting a second child to
      be named Thomas Wayne, Jr.<br />
      However, because of her intent to find a school for the underprivileged in
      Gotham, she was targeted by the manipulative Court of Owls,<br />
      who arranged for her to have a car accident. She and Bruce survived, but
      the accident forced Martha into premature labor, and the baby was lost.[2]
